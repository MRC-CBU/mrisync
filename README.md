This repo provides code for interfacing with the CBU MRI Scanner (3T Siemens
Prisma) over a National Instruments card. For further documentation of the CBU
setup, see the [imaging
wiki](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/mri/CbuStimulusDelivery).

# Matlab
For new projects, we recommend using [scansync.m](scansync.m). We also include a
legacy solution ([ScannerSynchClass.m](ScannerSynchClass.m), [documentation
here](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/mri/ScannerSynch)).

# Others
